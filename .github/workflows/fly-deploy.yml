# Name the workflow
# State that it will occur on a push to the main branch
name: Fly Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

# Create a job that deploys the app
#   The deployment will run on a GitHub server with ubuntu
#   The steps accomplish the following:
#     checkout the latest commit in the current repository
#     install flyctl on the GitHub server performing the deployment
#     deploy the application using flyctl deploy --remote-only
#   On the deplyment server, set the environmental variable FLY_API_TOKEN
#     Sets it to the value of the GitHub Actions secret named FLY_API_TOKEN
#     fly.io knows to use an environmental variable named FLY_API_TOKEN to authenticate deployment
